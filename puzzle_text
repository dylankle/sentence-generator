Amid the misty veil of a forgotten forest, a young knight named Cedric ventured toward the ominous shadow of Blackthorn Keep. Towering turrets pierced the crimson sky, guarded by a grim executioner wielding a gleaming axe, his silhouette a testament to unyielding vigilance. Whispers of enchantment echoed as Cedric navigated a labyrinth of gnarled trees that seemed alive, their skeletal branches clawing at his armor. A ghostly lantern guided him to a hidden glade, where a spectral queen, bound by an ancient curse, begged for deliverance. Armed with valor and a riddle-laden map, Cedric faced the perilous heart of the castle.
